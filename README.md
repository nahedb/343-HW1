Git commands that I will commonly use will be push, branch, checkout, status, add, commit -m, init, push origin, and merge. These are all commonly used commands by me as I have worked on other projects before using git and used all of these. I specifically used branch, push add, status, commit -m, and merge probably the most. I am very comfortable in git though and enjoy using it.
